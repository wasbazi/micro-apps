These days everyone is talking all about loosely coupled services, moving away
from monoliths and make applications/services small. This repo is a playground
for a number of different ways that this can be accomplished

## The Goal

To showcase and learn a number of ways that you can seamlessly integrate
multiple front-end applicatoins

# Installation/Usage

Make is your friend here.

## Setup

Run `make`

## Running the Apps

Each app will be a different make target. So far these are the ones implemented:

* `make angular`
